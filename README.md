# ShoeReleases
This program is currently in progress. As of right now, it takes the last 200 tweets of a user and checks for the
word Jordan. It then provides information regarding that Jordan, including the model and release date.
This program will eventually take this information and put it into an excel file, increasing the types of shoes that
it will look for within the tweets. The full project will eventually be taking this excel sheet, and tweeting about the
release of the shoe the day that it is releasing. I am also thinking about adding a feature that texts me about certain shock
drops.
