# ShoeReleases
This program is currently in progress. As of right now, it takes the last 200 tweets of a user and checks for the
word Jordan and Dunk. It then provides information regarding that Jordan, including the model and release date.
This program takes this information and puts it into an excel file, increasing the types of shoes that
it will look for within the tweets. The day before the release of the shoe, the program tweets the shoes model and color, along with the fact that it is going to be release the next day. Still need to deploy to continously run. Future additions will be sending an alert to phones, and the ability to restrict this alert to certain shoe models, along with tweeting and alerting about surprise shoe releases.
